# USA States Guessing Game  

A fun and interactive **U.S.A. state guessing game** built using **Python**,**Pandas** and **Turtle graphics**. Test your knowledge of U.S. states by guessing their names and placing them on the map!  

## 🎮 How to Play  
- A **blank U.S.A. map** appears on the screen.  
- A prompt asks you to **guess the name of a U.S.A. state**.  
- If your answer is correct, the state's name appears at its location on the map.  
- The game continues until you correctly guess all **50 states** or choose to exit.  
- If you exit early, a file **states_to_learn.csv** is created with the states you missed, so you can practice later!  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Interactive **state guessing** using **text input**  
✅ Displays correctly guessed states on the map  
✅ Tracks the number of correct answers  
✅ Saves **missed states** in a CSV file for future learning  
✅ Uses **pandas** for data handling and **Turtle graphics** for visualization
